# What is this?
A calculator made in javascript. 
I've always wanted to make this thing, and I was finally able to set aside a couple hours to make it.
It is a calculator that was made by actually parsing an AST, and not by calling `eval` like you see in all those javascript tutorials.

### Current feature set:
- Operators
    - `+ - * / %`
- Grouping things with braces
- Negative numbers (new)
    - yeah I forgot to add this the first time around
- Builtin functions
    - `sin cos tan ceil floor .....`
### What do I want to add next?

- Times
    - like `1:20am` and then we can add/subtract them to get durations and such
    - Also dates
- Custom functions
- Hex, binary, custom base numbers
- Big numbers. unlimited size numbers. and manually implement arithmetic
    - Might just yoink someone else's library for this. I can't be bothered
- Variables, loops, conditionals
- Vectors, matrices
- Some way to draw things
- A C++ port ?
